# My Account Modifications Plugin #

This plugin is built to support the modification of the WP/WooCommerce My Account pages. With the added complexcity of Oxygen Builder, functions.php and child-themes aren't available to modify WordPress layouts, thus, this plugin was born. It allows us to define replacement templates for core WooCommerce pages, as well as injects custom CSS for styling said templates to match the site it's installed on.

The foundation of this plugin uses code from: https://github.com/srikat/my-custom-functionality
